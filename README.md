# Welcome to the Sawitzki Lab Github

This repo contains two main branches of multiplex analysis software packages.

## Imaging mass cytometery 

The workflow is based in the [Bodenmiller](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/) pipeline and [Spectre](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/Spectre/). 
However, the code of Spectre has been adapted to allow batch normalization, gating, the complexheatmap package as well as euclidean distance measurements via signal-based masks created in imageJ.

## CyTOF

This is based on the work of Lev Petrov. More to come.
